# MDS Fulfillment Integration

This integration is designed to integrate Wombat with
[MDS Fulfillment](http://www.mdsfulfillment.com/) API.

This is a fully hosted and supported integration for use with the [Wombat](http://wombat.co)
product. With this integration you can perform the following functions:

* Push Orders to MDS Fulfillment
* Get Inventory stock / status from MDS Fulfillment
* Get Orders / Shipment updates from MDS Fulfillment

[Wombat](http://wombat.co) allows you to connect to your own custom integrations.
